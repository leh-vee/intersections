The child’s saucer eyes unstopped
the treble apprehension within,
the terrible pall undermining us
in the wet sand of now and then.
Yesterday’s great victory arose
like a whole pitfall swallowing up
the cherry we’d erected on top
overnight, above our cool charm.
What caught my attention was
how strange it'd been that the king
should die, choked out by a slice
of pie on the first day ever after.
We’d lost our daddy, but no one
more so than the old prince
who was too young to know what
to cry about, so the queen did
for all our looking into a moonful
of gleaming, perfectly empty plates.
I walked home, lapping around the
old cul-de-sac before stepping in
to the comfort of an apartment I
had just recovered from a sublettor.
Now that the great war was over
there was nothing more urgent
than to sit down and wait for what
was next. The baby would come
up with something. I should know
it like a round happiness: security’s
cornerstone forever falling in place.
