It was so
real flying
at night
through
the candy
of half lit
city faces
waiting to
be seized
when it
fell through,
a single hoot
redescribing
the network
of tunnels
my personae
backed into,
that I’d be
navigating
by her smell
blindly and
old stinking
from the joy
of another
start to all
that digging.
