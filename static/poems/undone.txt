Consider wonder. Segue to innocence. Let
your son’s love for red come to mind, until 
blood. Wipe up. Strobe the empty lot feeling.  
Ask the silent question. Make nature answer. 
Watch your wife's sleeping face, how gentle
it is. Or one of your sons, imagine being one
of them. Wrestle pity until it submits empathy.
Understand something about life, about people.
Test the wilderness of your mind again. Recall 
Nietzsche. Remember sailing out so small
onto big night. Wish you could still sleep right
through days. Appreciate the invisible hills
you’ve hauled down bare handed, like mountains.
Accept that you are an animal. Wander through
the implications. Sway over the fearsome
agitation. Breathe evenly. Draw back the curtain
to wait a bit. Watch the yard, unsure of what
next. Pull on a pair of jeans (almost wake
the wife). Mystify yourself with her perfume.
Unshelf tequila and Rilke. A flick of the wrist
ignites her car if you will. Don't you ever stop.
