It was at a golf club
near the airport, the
towering gold fern
along the length of
my wife’s black gown
was everywhere I
looked, set against
the rattle of her heavy
bracelets as we went
through the motions
at a party where
no one liked anybody,
really. I was wearing
blue, chequered pants
when she admitted how
the dress made her feel
she was there, in Africa
on a plantation before
the whole banquet table
subtly turned on us.
We left quickly to fuck
the dark complications
out of the burning 
silhouette in the dusk,
waiting in the doorway
for me to grab her stuff.
