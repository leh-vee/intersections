I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want her,
looking at her mouth to lick her lips.


I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want
her arranging for us to bump into 
one another somehow, someway.


I’d be lying if I said I didn’t
want her just laying there
watching tv suddenly, when
my ghost is finally let on in.


I'd be lying if I said I
didn't want her fell
breath dusting up
on my left shoulder
as the tango begins.


I’d be lying if I said
I didn’t want her to
want it in a boat
and the rain, on a
train or a car, but I
won’t look that far.


I’d be lying if I
said I did not
want her just 
as unsure, still
waiting for me
to arrive like a
good question.


I’d be lying if
I said I did
not want her
answering
my prayers
so I wouldn’t
have to get
on my knees.

I’d be lying
if I said I did
not want her
like I want
cake or pie,
ice cream
or the way
sometimes
I really don’t.


I’d be
lying if
I said I
did not
want her
making
an honest
man out
of me,
honestly.


I
could
be
lying
if
I
said
I
did
not
want
her.
