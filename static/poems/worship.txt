Like a blocked stenographer
poised over his key, we wait
for the mayor’s final word on
Power Punchlines : A Decree;
a poem requiring everyone 
to beautify the city by hanging
their shoes from the overhead
wiring. If heaven were a sky
blue attic she says, calling on
us to make a formal retraction.
There they go, walking home,
the most unbelievable lives
known—dangling, out of reach.
