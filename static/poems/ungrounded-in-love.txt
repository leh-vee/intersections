The fog stole through
my picturesque garden
view slower than I had
time for, fast asleep.
Looked good enough
to walk on first thing
in the morning; I reeled
down to the horizon.
Lost myself underfoot
in a boggy, giddy cloud
of feeling, until every step
felt a little like dipping
it in: a toe into the edge
of her everywhere else. I
was still in bed after all
without my infatuation
lying there beside me
at once, like an Adam
before Eve, empty as
a hot air balloon waking
to the soles of its feet.
