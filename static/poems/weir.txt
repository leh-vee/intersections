I had to see it for myself: the problem
with being so nice when what you have
on your hands is a stalemate crying out
for tough love. Meant to do it for the city
downstream of The City, a bureaucracy
with so many layers I found its excesses
reflected in the gilded tower I was helpless
to note every time I exited the train station
stepping, without fail into that feeling like
this, is all this really how I want to live now.
Take a walk on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
cutting away from the office through the
breathable light exposing whatever is so
blithe about Front street’s serious throngs;
an ant colony striving in my empty room,
after noon. That feeling when dusk comes  
in of I prefer this place, its air refreshing
my mind before the pilgrimage, until I’m
a body in time with the multiplex bending
toward the abyssal edge, reducing inside
into iota, like a mythic fish smashing free
of the weir for no less than a taste of me.
