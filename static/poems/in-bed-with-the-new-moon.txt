I crawled into bed with them
to feel nothing, see nothing
like a new moon drifting in to
frame a mild, mid December.
I wasn’t thinking about it, how
my father’s people had killed
him, because it wasn’t true.
Or the way my mother’s didn’t
believe in sacrifice now that
they did their our own research.
What I liked best was quietly
seeking out the wet mystery
of our otherwise dry nest egg
and lying there silently without
a clue like father, like son like
unscrewed from the cross, like
a choked chicken unable to
hold itself back from intercourse
with the whole haunted house.
