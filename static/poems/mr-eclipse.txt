You spend your life
waiting for the moon 
to make its move
against the sun, just
once every twenty years
or so, so unprepared
for anything real or
true anymore but
the surrender of rage 
for all our happy endings.
To be faced then, with
hope’s modesty once more
and again, the crowning
lifetime of a moment.
