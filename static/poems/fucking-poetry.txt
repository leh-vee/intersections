I'd been trying hard to make it big
for years before leading my flesh
into a risky turn that spat us across
Bay street with ease, settling us deep
in the luxuriant ravine of an otherwise
empty financial district. Didn’t even
bother with a briefcase or a sport coat,
just rode in on a nose for what felt
good at the time, and a bit of dumb luck.
It counts, money, but I can't figure out
what. It doesn’t smell of anything, no
not even the poetry of garbage. I still
dream of the old ward, nights when I
kissed her for the first time and prayed
so hard to be seen for who I could be
I managed to unlock the foolproof bin
overflowing with the stink of ambrosia.
