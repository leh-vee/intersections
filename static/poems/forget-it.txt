I don't remember a thing about
how I let our friendship crumble
in order to let myself become an
other I didn't quite comprehend
besides the embarrassing sense
that she was a little more French
than one could be, especially here.
I'd prefer not to think about it, our
middle-class, high school, and its
unaccountable way of gazing back
into the welfare of a wonderful future
perched for us like a penthouse at
the very pinnacle of history's horror
and the lingering trauma about my
family's misfortune to always seek
despair. I went night swimming all
by myself, testing the limits of what
uptown was willing to accept from 
my girlish legs, as I swung them over
the fence. Everyone, even the cops
seemed to understand immediately
that I was a harmless loner and left
me to myself with a knowing smile.
It was the summer I learned to float.
