Check out the butt on that collapsed guy
down the platform again when the night
shift authority almost kissed his distant 
hidden lips to his walkie-talkie and I inch
closer grazing the coarse wall. I sit close 
to the upside down face sleeping here on
the train, while neatly pressed men stand
around him fading out fast like we're all in
this together. They are friends. Were we?
No after all, just gifted kids stuffed inside
the same box. His terrible stash flying
across my binder to catch a water balloon
once. Now they're making a doc about
it, his break with reality not his attempt
to save me. He was utterly normal then, 
surviving himself like the rest of us in
school, boring. You found it funny at first, 
yes: that he’d dumped buckets of urine
and feces, his own I guess, over their
heads’, doing it to strangers right out in
public. In his portrait he looked so defiant
as the news broke, our silent reunion of
sorts. Because you have never known
how to dump it, all of it, your shame or on 
who. But you'd like to. Yes, sometimes I
am so smart that no one even talks to me.
