My upstairs neighbor might be
in love. Anyway his girlfriend has
pretty much moved in. They fuck
all the time. And I hear them
getting to know each other or
whatever it is we do to one another
on the balcony above mine, 
while I pretend to read Maggie
Millner. Great cover, the colours. 
But I can’t make out anything, just
the nudes of his undertone:
something something something
about work – he’s a prop master
or whatever – then her laughter.
She laughs often and loudly,
seemingly at the very sound
of his voice. I saw them once
taking out the garbage together.
They skipped past me, my
threshold while I was doubled
over, lacing up my runners.
She laughed of course, to see
her wounded rapture's echo
so nakedly bent over, I suppose.
Not sure I like her, but maybe
she can stay for the summer.
