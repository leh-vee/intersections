The moon can’t let go
of its powerful minor key,
casting such a brilliant
doubt over everything
(the werewolf’s sense
of humour, her beauty
bathing in the light, what
else shifts with the tide)
that he can hardly stand
it, the luminous terror of
having made all this up,
like the caress of snow 
drifts and their sparkling
reveal of love’s unfinished,
open shape. Look at him
roll over playing dead, a
crescent eye holding on
to leon by his lone end.
