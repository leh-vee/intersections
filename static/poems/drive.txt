A dude found a middle aged body
hiding beneath his dark robes
on a weekend long retreat up north.
I’ve always wanted you like this
in secrecy, in your unsightly anguish
like a mama bear that has lost all
its fur, streaking across the forest
road for me to let into the quiet
suchness of light that goes on when
I stop and open the door of my car.
We drove on in silence for a long
while before I could make out my
quiet prayer to be eaten. When
should I stop and hand her the key?
